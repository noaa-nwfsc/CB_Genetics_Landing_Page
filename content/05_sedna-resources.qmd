### Github Push/Pull from Sedna

-   In order to push changes from sedna to github repositories, you need to set up an ssh key. **Log into sedna** and follow these instructions **from your home directory**:

    -   [Instructions on github](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)

    -   Run this: 

``` bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

-   Press enter to save key to default location

-   Enter a secure passphrase (prompted twice)

Note: you do not need to use ssh-agent, but you can set up ssh-agent if you would like to avoid re-entering passphrase for every push. Ignore the portion on hardware security keys

-   Next add your SSH key to your github account by copying the key you generated on sedna to your github account

    -   [Instructions on git](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

    -   Run the following in sedna:

``` bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

-   Add key and copy output from above into key field: <https://github.com/settings/keys>

Now when you run git push, you will be prompted to enter your pass phrase for your ssh key. If you added your key to the ssh-agent, you will not be prompted for a pass phrase. **These steps allow you to push and pull to repositories in your personal github (name-NOAA).**

**To push to a repository in the enterprise, you will need to set up SSO**: 

-   Instructions on git: [Authorize ssh key for SSO](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/authorizing-an-ssh-key-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on)

-   Go to page with your key: <https://github.com/settings/keys>

-   Click configure SSO

-   Click an organization to authorize
