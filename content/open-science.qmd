## What is Open Science?

Open science is a movement that aims to make scientific research, data, and publications available to everyone. It encourages collaboration, transparency, and productivity.

NOAA Fisheries has an Open Science Initiative with the intent to support scientists, developers, resource managers, and policy analysts in the adoption of modern, open, reproducible scientific workflows that enhance our already groundbreaking scientific work.This vision importantly also enables more timely fulfillment of NOAAâ€™s Open Science mandates:
